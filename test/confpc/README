Conformal mesh for a parabolic cylinder

1. Check the paths in run.sh
2. Note that you need the confpc mesh generator
3. Also note that confpc uses the old ji ordering so
   that you need to use the -ms option when running npot
4. ./run.sh

Note that to converge this it is helpful to restart with
several different values of sigma 

To use paraview you may want to do:

ln -s grid.dat grid.xyz
